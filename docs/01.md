# Introduction

Hymple is a cryptocurrency exchange designed to unify the benefits of centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) models into a single hybrid solution. Its core operates with off-chain order books, allowing **low latency**, **high liquidity** and superior performance in order execution.

The platform adopts an **non-custodial**, ensuring that users retain full control over their assets. This eliminates risks associated with intermediary custody and significantly reduces common attack vectors present in traditional exchanges.

Hymple also stands out for **not requiring KYC**, preserving user privacy without compromising operational integrity. The approach combines security, transparency and a simplified experience, removing barriers to entry and making the environment ideal for both beginners and advanced traders.

The goal is to establish a bridge between accessibility, financial sovereignty and global scalability, setting a new standard of efficiency and freedom in the crypto assets sector.

### **Level of Decentralization**

Hymple was designed to unite freedom, security and auditability, balancing decentralization and operational efficiency.

* Users retain full control over their assets.
* No private key is stored by the platform.
* Interactions with smart contracts — swaps, staking and liquidity — occur directly on the blockchain.

As such, Hymple does not act as a traditional broker nor as a custodial institution.

### **Hybrid Architecture**

The Hymple ecosystem combines two complementary layers:

#### **On-Chain Layer (Decentralized)**

Responsible for swaps, staking, liquidity and governance of the HYM token.\
All code is **open-source**, auditable and verifiable.

#### **Off-Chain Layer (Operational)**

Includes the matching engine, APIs, order management and monitoring services.\
For security and intellectual property reasons, its code is not open, but:

* execution records,
* fees,
* operational metrics

are made available in public and auditable logs.

### **Transparency and Audit**

Hymple adopts a model of **verifiable transparency**, with:

* Public execution logs and operational metrics
* Immutable and traceable on-chain transactions
* Periodic independent audits
* Public dashboards with indicators of liquidity, volume and fees

This structure allows the community to monitor the system’s integrity without compromising security or performance.

### **Governance and Ownership**

Hymple **is not a DAO**.\
It has centralized and transparent governance, led by the founding team, responsible for strategic and operational decisions.

However, it incorporates elements of participatory governance via smart contracts, allowing the community to vote on topics such as:

* Improvement proposals
* Fee or reward adjustments
* Use of funds for development or marketing

These mechanisms complement — but do not replace — central governance.

### **Strategic Positioning**

Hymple positions itself as a hybrid, auditable and transparent ecosystem that balances decentralization and efficiency:

* 🔒 **Non-custodial**
* 🧩 **On-chain contracts that are open-source and auditable**
* ⚙ **High-performance proprietary off-chain infrastructure**
* 🌐 **Verifiable transparency**
* 🗳 **On-chain participatory governance**

The result is a hybrid exchange that combines the sovereignty of DEXs with the operational efficiency of CEXs.
